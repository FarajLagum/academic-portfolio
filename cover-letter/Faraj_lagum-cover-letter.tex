I am writing in response to your advertisement for the Adjunct Faculty in  \textbf{Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program} at \textbf{\youruniversity}, as advertised on the college's website. I respectfully submit this application because I believe my experiences and commitment to research and teaching make me well-qualified to meet the needs of your department's program.

\vspace{1em}

I am an excellent fit for your department as I have the industrial, research, teaching and curriculum development \ignore{, and funding experience} you are seeking. As you can see from my attached CV, I have all the essential required skills for the job:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I have a  Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering; I have passed both my Ph.D.'s comprehensive exam and defence with distinction. Additionally, my Ph.D. thesis was unanimously nominated by the examination board for the Carleton University Medal. Also, I obtained my BSc. and MSc. degrees in Electrical and Electronics Engineering , both with honours, from the University of Benghazi, Benghazi, the most prestigious university in Libya.
    \item I had experience as an Applied Machine Learning Postdoctoral Researcher at Carleton University. 
    During my postdoctoral fellowship, I directed and served as a project manager for Industry and government-funded projects on machine learning and natural language processing. This position allowed me to develop my research skills further and deepen my understanding of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
    \item I have extensive industrial experience. Currently, I hold two key roles: a Co-Founding Machine Learning Engineer at Supplyrisk AI in Ottawa, and the Chief Technology Officer at Vosyn in Toronto.  Previously, I worked as Machine Learning Engineer, and project manager. 
    \item    I have a track record of experience developing Software as a Service (SaaS) web applications. I have strong programming skills with standard programming languages such as Python, Matlab, and C++, and  I have an in-depth understanding of the full software development lifecycle (Planning, Design, prototyping, implementation, testing, documentation, and maintenance).
    \item Throughout my Ph.D. program, I published 6 IEEE journal papers and 1 IEEE flagship conference paper. Also, I published one poster and authored two technical reports during my postdoctoral fellowship. Additionally, I have collaborated on various industrial research projects and software packages. Currently, I have three journal papers in various stages of review, preparation, or preprint. Notably, my publications have garnered recognition within the research community, with over 1100 citations to date.
    \item I was the lead winner of the 2nd Prize Best Poster Award, Carleton University DataDay 7.1, 2021. 
    \item I have more than four years of teaching and curriculum development experience at the University of Benghazi as well as eight years of experience in teaching assistance (3 years at the University of Benghazi, Libya, and 5 years at Carleton University, Canada). %My teaching experience spans several courses.
    \item I have extensive mentorship experience as I have mentored more than 30 students throughout my career during their undergrad graduation projects, thesis, and research papers. %Additionally, I mentored more than 80 engineers.  
    \item I am experienced in identifying funding opportunities, writing grant applications \& research proposals, and building industrial partnerships. For example, I am taking part in a partnership building between Vosyn and Amazon as well as between Vosyn and The BE Company, UK.

   \item I successfully obtained AWS credits valued at \$11,000 USD, with additional credits of up to \$150,000 USD can be secured. Similar credits can also be obtained from other cloud service providers.
   
   %I was able to secure AWS credits valued at \$11,000 USD, and additional credit up to \$150,000 USD is on track to be secured. Similar credit can be secured from other cloud service providers. 

\item %When it comes to hands-on skills, 
    I have a track record of experience developing Software as a Service (SaaS) applications. I have strong programming skills with standard programming languages such as Python, Matlab, and C++, and  I have an in-depth understanding of the full software development lifecycle (Planning, Design, prototyping, implementation, testing, documentation, and maintenance).

    
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}

Additionally, I have other desirable requirements for the job:

\begin{itemize}
    %\item As for my eligibility to work in Canada, I am a Canadian Citizen.
    
      \item I have strong leadership, management, communications, and organization skills.
      
    \item As a member of a visible minority myself, I believe that everyone deserves to feel safe, respected and included regardless of their cultures, backgrounds, and viewpoints so they can create, innovate, and thrive. I am committed to embracing equity and diversity and cultivating an inclusive workplace and discipline.
    
  \item At the University of Benghazi, I advised students to define, develop and achieve their educational/career plans during the first-year orientation sessions and throughout their academic journey; participated in curriculum development and decision-making in the department council; and carried out department administrative duties such as setting up courses timetable, and student admissions. I am committed to providing these services and outreach activities at \youruniversity.
  
  \item I am deeply committed to fostering community engagement and outreach initiatives in data science and machine learning engineering, ranging from organizing workshops and seminars to hosting hackathons and coding competitions. Through industry partnerships, STEM outreach in schools, and online resources, II strive to inspire the next generation of data scientists and machine learning engineers. My dedication to these initiatives aligns with  \youruniversity's values and mission, and I am eager to contribute to its academic endeavours.
  
 \item Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have cultivated a passion for teaching and mentoring students and interns in the field of \ignore{Computer Engineering} Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. With a solid foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical application, I am well-equipped to teach a range of core Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program program courses, including deep learning, Machine Learning, Natural language processing (NLP), Large Language models, Big data, software engineering, database management, web applications, Algorithms and Data Structures, Computer Networks, and a range of core Mathematics courses.
