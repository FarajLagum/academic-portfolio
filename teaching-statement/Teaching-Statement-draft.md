# Teaching Statement



My interest in teaching and education has started during my postgraduate studies, and my
pedagogical experience has evolved over time as I gained more experience from each teaching duty
I had. My first teaching experience was as a Teaching Assistant at University of
Benghazi during which I was fortunate to learn the teaching practice of well qualified professors. At that time, I was responsible for leading tutorials, marking assignments, and help the
students in their projects. As I enjoy teaching and its associated activities, I used to provide an
extensive feedback on the student work within a tight timeline. After three years of being a TA, and based on the based on the positive recommendations of both professors and students I secured a position as a Lecture Assistance (instructor) at the Electrical and electronic engineering deperatement once I finished my MSc. study. 

I coninuted to teach at University of Benghazi from July 2008 to december 2012 where I left the university to pursue my PhD in Canada after a secured a persitgouse scholarship based on the University recommendation form the Libyan Misistry of higher recommendation.  

In July, 2008, after I finished MSc. study, I secured a position as a Lecture at the Electrical and electronic engineering deperatement, Univeristy of Benghazi,  where I continuted to teach for more that four years until left the departement and come to Canada to pursue my PhD. 

During my four years tuner At Univeristy of Benghazi I used to teach two courses every semester. These courses include Telecommunication Theory I & II; Electromagnetics I & II; Microwaves; and Antenna \& Propagation; C++, and Matlab. 



In the beginning of this role, I tend to focus on explaining main concepts and ideas of the subject and on solving various problems to the students clearly and in a simplified manner. Later, after the first semester, I realized it is more important to develop the students critical thinking capabilities and problem-solving techniques and to reduce the mathematical anxiety, especially to the undergraduate students, rather than focusing on solving numerical problems. To achieve this target, I involved the students in the learning process by asking them questions and encourage them to ask questions, by giving more practical and technical examples from the real world, and more importantly by unifying the seemingly disparate concepts. In particular, I recognized that many concepts that are repeated in several modules may initially appear to be disparate ideas. 



For instance, in Wireless Communications courses, the wireless receivers employ filters to receive the signals of interest and block other unwanted signals. While in Digital Communications courses, the same filters are used to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. Moreover, in Digital Signal Processing courses, several efficient ways exist to implement such filters. Hence, I like to show the cohesive nature of these filters by presenting their applications in various courses. This unification approach reduces the students’ mathematical anxiety and allows them to focus their effort on the developing of the problem-solving techniques, instead of spending time to understand the same concepts and mathematical analysis over gain, merely because it was presented in a different way or using a different notation. After adopting this teaching practice, the official students’ feedback was positive and encouraging and many students acknowledged this way of teaching to be very efficient and meet their expectations. 





After joining Ulster University as an Assistant Professor, I realized that teaching in higher education
is a complex and multifaceted task that includes face-to-face teaching, curriculum design, use of
digital technology, designing engaging students’ assessments, and postgraduate supervision. At my
role at Ulster University, my view on teaching and learning practice has evolved and now I view
students as partners that have to be actively engaged in the teaching and learning activities to better
understand the global context of their studies and be prepared to the job market. Thus, a clear
understanding of the students’ needs is crucial to deliver the teaching and learning outcomes. At
Ulster University, I taught three courses with diverse students’ requirements. For instance, in
Communications I and II, I conducted a brief survey at the beginning of the semester and I realized
that most of the students are working part-time in various telecommunication industries. They
came with different expectations that the module somehow should cover topics related to their
industry. This is a challenging task as the field of communication is ever-growing and we have a
short end-of-term exam to test the students’ knowledge, and hence, the learning outcomes may not
properly be achieved. In addition to a final exam, this course has a mid-semester class test that in
my view tests the students’ in a way similar to the final exam. I requested to change the coursework
for this course to include a research project that covers various telecommunication topics needed
by the students. The topics that I suggested for the research project match the recently announced
themes of Innovate UK and include 5G communication systems, drone-based communications,
applications of artificial intelligence in future networks, and wireless body area networks. The
students’ feedback were very positive and encouraging. Another challenging task I faced at Ulster
University is teaching large-size classes and design appropriate assessment. I taught Electrical
Engineering Fundamentals for first year students with a class size of approximately 175 students.
After analyzing the poor performance of students in previous years, we realized that the assessment
coursework during the semester was not engaging and does not continuously measure the students
understanding. That said, I adopted a clicker-based system to test students’ knowledge, at the end
of each lecture and seminar, by presenting a simple electrical circuit for the student to analyze and
then pick the correct answer. This technique was proven to be effective in engaging the students in
the learning process, as well as, encourage them to study for each lecture and seminar. The students’
feedback at the end of the module was very positive and the success rate have improved
significantly compared to previous years. However, there were some ripples and a percent of the
students were not fully satisfied. This is something that I am keen to improve in future.
Also, at Ulster University, I actively participate in the revalidation process of the computing systems
program. I proposed and designed a module COM444: Communications and Networks for
undergraduate students that covers a range of new wireless technologies. This was an enriching
experience for me and I gained a lot about designing modules, choosing suitable assessment type
for the students’ cohort, engaging the stakeholders, and balance the coursework over the semester
and with respect to other modules.



At University of Saskatchewan, I already prepared to teach courses on the following subjects: digital
signal processing, digital communications, communication theory, wireless communications,
stochastic process, signals and systems, and computer networks. I am also open to prepare to teach
other subjects are required by the department.
My commitment for being an excellent teacher in higher education is sincere. I am an Associate
Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and currently enrolled in the course of post-graduatePage 
certificate in higher education practice (PgCHEP) that I expect to finish by the end of this year and
hold the full fellowship. My understanding of, and practice in, effective learning, teaching, and
assessment and feedback have been well developed. I am looking forward to continuing my
commitment to excellent teaching at University of Saskatchewan
