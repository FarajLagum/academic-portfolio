\section{Teaching Philosophy}
For my point of view, teaching is the act of communicating knowledge and coaching minds to think critically. Teaching is about stretching the brains, not just filling them with information. As Plutarch (45 AD---120 AD) said: ``the mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting.'' To make the teaching intellectually rewarding for the students, I believe that the instructor must set high standards for the course and maintain motivating his students to adopt the deep learning approach. To make that happen, I believe that the instructor should create a non-threatening and fun learning atmosphere in which the students can explore new concepts, make mistakes, and get feedback without any judgment. Moreover, the instructor should also pose stimulating and intriguing questions that are very challenging for the students. In my opinion, teaching is about training the students to analyze and interpret the meaning of each formula or text. 

\section{Teaching Interests}

Without any exaggeration, I am well trained to teach courses such as the Electromagnetic Waves. I have profound experience in teaching similar courses. During my graduate and undergraduate studies, I attended several courses in Electromagnetics, Antenna, and Microwaves, where I always get excellent marks. My M.Sc. was about computational electromagnetics. The title of my thesis is: ``\emph{Moment Method Analysis of a Liner Wire Antenna Using Exponential Subdomain Function.}'' Indeed, Electromagnetic Waves is among the fields of my expertise. I am interested in teaching the Electromagnetic Waves course. I am also interested in teaching the Switching Circuits course.


\section{Teaching Experience}
I have more than 14 years of teaching experience. During my career, I have been a trainer, teaching assistant, and lecturer. I had been a full-time lecturer at Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, University of Benghazi (UoB), Benghazi, Libya, for more than four years. The undergraduate program at UoB has two Electromagnetic courses, one Antenna \& Propagation course, and one Microwaves course. During my working at UoB, I used to teach Electromagnetics II and a Telecommunications courses every term. However, from term to term, I sometimes teach Antenna~\&~Propagation, Electromagnetics I, or Microwaves courses. When I was teaching the electromagnetic courses, I chose the ``\emph{Engineering Electromagnetics}'' by William H. Hayt and ``\emph{Elements of electromagnetics}'' by Matthew N.O. Sadiku are the textbook and the main reference, respectively. Before that, I worked as a TA at UoB for three years during my M.Sc. study where I used to be a TA mostly for the  Circuit theory, Digital Circuits, and Electronics courses. Currently, I am a TA, RA, and Ph.D. candidate at the Systems and Computer EnginerringDepartement, Carleton University. Prof. Halim Yanikomeroglu is my supervisor. At Carleton, I have been a TA for several courses. More about my teaching experience is described in my curriculum vitae.
